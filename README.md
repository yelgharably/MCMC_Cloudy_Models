# Monte Carlo Markov Chain Cloudy Statistical Model Builder
This program is a modification of the work done by Charles Reisner 24' (Franklin and Marshall College) in his undergraduate thesis. 
It's a script that runs the MCMC algorithim to build a statistical model from generated CLOUDY synthesized outputs and compare it to data from the CECILIA survey. 

Read through the pdf attached in the project for more information, this pdf was written as a research summary and reflection for my summer research on this project with Professor Ryan Trainor in Franklin and Marshall College.
